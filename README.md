# Cluster Blob

A small API to handle media for the Cluster application, which you can see in my profile (now its currently private). The point is, a storage that uses the filesystem and generates random id's that will point to the correct file, automatically handling an returning the image.

### Info

Make sure that all the folders of each type exist on the public folder.
